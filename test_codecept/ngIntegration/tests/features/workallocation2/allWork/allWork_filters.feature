    Background: Mock and browser setup
        Given I init MockApp


    Scenario Outline: Tasks filters services displayed based for role assignment on service(s) <roleAssignment_services>

        Given I set MOCK with user "IAC_CaseOfficer_R2" and roles "caseworker-ia-caseofficer,caseworker-ia-admofficer,task-supervisor,case-allocator" with reference "userDetails"
        Given I set Mock user with ref "userDetails", ORGANISATION roles for services "<roleAssignment_services>" allow empty service
            | roleName    | task-supervisor |
            | substantive | Y               |



        Given I set MOCK tasks with permissions for view "All work" and assigned state ""
