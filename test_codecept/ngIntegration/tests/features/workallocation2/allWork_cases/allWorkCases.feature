    Background: Mock and browser setup
        Given I init MockApp

    Scenario Outline:  All cases, colums and column links for "<UserType>"
        
        Given I set MOCK with user details
            | roles | <Roles>,task-supervisor,case-allocator |
            | roleCategory | <roleCategory> |
        
        Given I set Mock user with ref "userDetails", ORGANISATION roles for services "IA" allow empty service
            | roleName    | task-supervisor |
            | substantive | Y               |

        Given I set MOCK user with reference "userDetails" roleAssignmentInfo
            | jurisdiction | caseType | substantive | roleType | caseId           |roleCategory|
            | IA | Asylum | Y | CASE | 1234567812345670 | <roleCategory> |
            | SSCS | Asylum | Y | CASE | 1234567812345671 | <roleCategory> |

        Given I navigate to home page
        When I click on primary navigation header tab "All work", I see selected tab page displayed
        When I navigate to All work sub navigation tab "Cases"

        Then I see find person search results in work flow
            | Person                       |
            | auto test 1 judge 1 (auto_test_judge_1@justice.gov.uk) |

        When I select find person result "auto test 1 judge 1 (auto_test_judge_1@justice.gov.uk)" in work flow

        When I click Apply filter button in all work page

            | Person        |
            | Hearing date |

        Then I validate work allocation table columns are links
            | ColumnHeader |
            | Case name    |

        When I click work allocation case column link "Case name" at row 1
        Then I see case details page

            | IAC_Judge_WA_R2 | Judge    | caseworker-ia-iacjudge,caseworker-ia,caseworker |JUDICIAL|

    Scenario Outline: All cases pagnation control display with only 1 page of items

        Given I set MOCK with user details
            | roles        | <Roles>,task-supervisor,case-allocator |
