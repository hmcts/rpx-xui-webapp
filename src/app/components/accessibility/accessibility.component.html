         <p class="govuk-body">HM Courts & Tribunals Service is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
         <p class="govuk-body">This website is partially compliant with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>
         <h1 class="govuk-heading-l" id="Non-accessible-content">Non-accessible content </h1>
         <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-compliant for the following reasons.</p>
         <p class="govuk-body">Some of the PDFs, documents, and attachments to email notifications may not meet accessibility standards. For example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This is because the majority were created before the current accessibility legislation was introduced. We plan to test these and make them accessible by September 2020.</p>

         <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="Disproportionate-burden">Disproportionate burden</h3>
         <p class="govuk-body">Some pages cannot be navigated completely using just a keyboard, so some people with accessibility needs won’t be able to tab through the pages. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1 (keyboard accessible).</p>
         <p class="govuk-body">Some pages can’t be listened to in full using a screen reader, so some people won’t be able to access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.2.5 (audio description – prerecorded).</p>
         <p class="govuk-body">Some of the contrast ratios don’t mind the current accessibility requirements. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 (contrast – minimum).</p>
         <p class="govuk-body">Expert UI has carried out manual accessibility testing using the chrome extension Axe. Axe is complying with WCAG 2 and Section 508 accessibility (which covers WCAG 2.1).</p>
         <p class="govuk-body">For Manage Organisation, Register Organisation, Approve Organisation and Manage Cases, we found the following issues that are currently being triaged:</p>
         <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
         <li>Screen readers can’t switch between headers, read content in tabs and buttons</li>
         <li>Screen readers can’t tab between radio buttons, read links or content</li>
         <li>Colour contrast ratios uneven between page background and content</li>
         </ul>

         <p class="govuk-body">PDFs, documents and attachments to email notifications published before 23 September 2018 may not meet accessibility standards. For example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader.</p>
