Download data from iana.org/time-zones.', function (version) {\n8          version = version || 'latest';\n\n10          var done  = this.async(),\n11              src   = 'ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/tzdata-latest.tar.gz',\n12              curl  = path.resolve('temp/curl', version, 'data.tar.gz'),\n13              dest  = path.resolve('temp/download', version);\n...\n24          exec('curl ' + src + ' -o ' + curl + ' && cd ' + dest + ' && gzip -dc ' + curl + ' | tar -xf -', function (err) {\n```\n\nOrdinarily, one one run this script using something like `grunt data-download:2014d`, in which case version would have the value `2014d`. However, if an attacker were to provide additional content on the command line, they would be able to execute arbitrary code\n\n```\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# grunt 'data-download:2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #'\n\\Running \"data-download:2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #\" (data-download) task\n>> Downloading https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/tzdata2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #.tar.gz\n>> Downloaded https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/tzdata2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #.tar.gz\n\nDone.\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# cat /tmp/foo\nflag\n```\n\n#### Command Injection via data-zdump.js\n\nThe `tasks/data-zdump.js` script reads a list of files present in a temporary directory (created by previous tasks), and for each one, assembles and executes a command line without sanitization. As a result, an attacker able to influence the contents of that directory could gain code execution. This attack is exacerbated by timezone data being downloaded via cleartext FTP (described above), but beyond that, an attacker at iana.org able to modify the timezone files could disrupt any systems that build moment-timezone.\n\n```\n15              files     = grunt.file.expand({ filter : 'isFile', cwd : 'temp/zic/' + version }, '**/*');\n...\n27          function next () {\n...\n33              var file = files.pop(),\n34                  src  = path.join(zicBase, file),\n35                  dest = path.join(zdumpBase, file);\n36              exec('zdump -v ' + src, { maxBuffer: 20*1024*1024 }, function (err, stdout) {\n```\n\nIn this case, an attacker able to add a file to `temp/zic/2014d` (for example) with a filename like `Z; curl www.example.com` would influence the called to exec on line 36 and run arbitrary code. There are a few minor challenges in exploiting this, since the string needs to be a valid filename.\n\n#### Command Injection via data-zic.js\n\nSimilar to the vulnerability in /tasks/data-download.js, the /tasks/data-zic.js script takes a version from the command line and uses it as part of a command line, executed without sanitization.\n\n```\n10          var done  = this.async(),\n11              dest  = path.resolve('temp/zic', version),\n...\n22              var file = files.shift(),\n23                  src = path.resolve('temp/download', version, file);\n24\n25              exec('zic -d ' + dest + ' ' + src, function (err) {\n```\n\nAs a result, an attacker able to influence that string can run arbitrary commands. Of course, it requires an attacker able to influence the command passed to grunt, so may be unlikely in practice.\n\n```\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# grunt 'data-zic:2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo '\nRunning \"data-zic:2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo \" (data-zic) task\nexec: zid -d /usr/src/app/moment-timezone/temp/zic/2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo  /usr/src/app/moment-timezone/temp/download/2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo /africa\n...\n\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# cat /tmp/evil\nhi\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThe supplied patch on top of 0.5.34 is applicable with minor tweaks to all affected versions. It switches `exec` to `execFile` so arbitrary bash fragments won't be executed any more.\n\n### References\n\n* https://knowledge-base.secureflag.com/vulnerabilities/code_injection/os_command_injection_nodejs.html\n* https://auth0.com/blog/preventing-command-injection-attacks-in-node-js-apps/","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-56x4-j7p9-fcf9"},"1088403":{"findings":[{"version":"0.5.34","paths":["moment-timezone"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":">=0.1.0 <0.5.35","module_name":"moment-timezone","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-v78c-4p63-2j6c","cves":[],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=0.5.35","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"updated":"2023-01-12T05:07:10.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 0.5.35 or later","cwe":["CWE-319"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1088403,"references":"- https://github.com/moment/moment-timezone/security/advisories/GHSA-v78c-4p63-2j6c\n- https://github.com/moment/moment-timezone/commit/7915ac567ab19700e44ad6b5d8ef0b85e48a9e75\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v78c-4p63-2j6c","created":"2022-08-30T20:28:43.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information in moment-timezone","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\n\n* if Alice uses `grunt data` (or `grunt release`) to prepare a custom-build, moment-timezone with the latest tzdata from IANA's website\n* and Mallory intercepts the request to IANA's unencrypted ftp server, Mallory can serve data which might exploit further stages of the moment-timezone tzdata pipeline, or potentially produce a tainted version of moment-timezone (practicality of such attacks is not proved)\n\n### Patches\nProblem has been patched in version 0.5.35, patch should be applicable with minor modifications to all affected versions.

However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\n \nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n \n```js\nconst JSON5 = require('json5');\n\nconst doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n  if (props.isAdmin) {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n  } else {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n  }\n};\n\nconst secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n  let searchKeyFound = false;\n  Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n    if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n      searchKeyFound = true;\n    }\n  });\n  return searchKeyFound;\n};\n\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\"}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as user.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n \nIf the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"isAdmin\": true}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props);\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...\n}\n```\n \nHowever, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\"isAdmin\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n

The purpose of this parameter is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function in order to make password brute-force and dictionary attacks more expensive.\n\nThis makes the PBES2 algorithms unsuitable for situations where the JWE is coming from an untrusted source: an adversary can intentionally pick an extremely high PBES2 Count value, that will initiate a CPU-bound computation that may take an unreasonable amount of time to finish.\n\n### Impact\n\nUnder certain conditions (see below) it is possible to have the user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time.\n\n### Affected users\n\nThe impact is limited only to users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs with symmetric secrets to decrypt JWEs from untrusted parties who do not limit the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms (`alg` Header Parameter) using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` (or `algorithms` in v1.x) decryption option or through other means.\n\nThe PBKDF2-based JWE Key Management Algorithm Identifiers are\n\n- `PBES2-HS256+A128KW`\n- `PBES2-HS384+A192KW`\n- `PBES2-HS512+A256KW`\n\ne.g.\n\n```js\nconst secret = new Uint8Array(16)\nconst jwe = '...' // JWE from an untrusted party\n\nawait jose.compactDecrypt(jwe, secret)\n```\n\nYou are NOT affected if any of the following applies to you\n\n- Your code does not use the JWE APIs\n- Your code only produces JWE tokens\n- Your code only decrypts JWEs using an asymmetric JWE Key Management Algorithm (this means you're providing an asymmetric key object to the JWE decryption API)\n- Your code only accepts JWEs produced by trusted sources\n- Your code limits the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option not including any of the PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms\n\n### Patches\n\n`v1.28.2`, `v2.0.6`, `v3.20.4`, and `v4.9.2` releases limit the maximum PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000` by default. It is possible to adjust this limit with a newly introduced `maxPBES2Count` decryption option.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll users should be able to upgrade given all stable semver major release lines have had new a patch release introduced which limits the PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000` by default. This removes the ability to craft JWEs that would consume unreasonable amount of CPU time.\n\nIf users are unable to upgrade their required library version they have two options depending on whether they expect to receive JWEs using any of the three PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms.\n\n- they can use the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option to disable accepting PBKDF2 altogether\n- they can inspect the JOSE Header prior to using the decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count (`p2c` Header Parameter)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or
