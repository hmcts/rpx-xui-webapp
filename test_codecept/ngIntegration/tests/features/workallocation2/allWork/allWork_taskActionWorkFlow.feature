        Given I start MockApp
        Given I navigate to home page

        When I click on primary navigation header tab "All work", I see selected tab page displayed
        Then I validate tasks count in page 25

        Given I capture task details at row <taskAtRow> with reference "taskDetails"

        When I open Manage link for task at row <taskAtRow>
        Then I see action link "<actionLink>" is present for task with Manage link open
        When I click action link "<actionLink>" on task with Manage link open

        Then I see "<actionHeader>" task action page
        Then I validate task action page has description "<actionDescription>"

        Then I validate task details displayed in task action page
            | Case name        | Case category      | Location      |
            | Allwork test scr | auto test category | London QA lab |

        When I click "<submitBtnLabel>" submit button in task action page
        Then I see navigation header tab page "All work"
        Then I validate notification message banner is displayed in "All work" page
        # Then I validate notification banner messages displayed in "All work" page
        #     | message                                   |
        #     | <bannermessage> |
