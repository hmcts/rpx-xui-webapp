 * @description due to some bad design from rd API below is created,
 * and they said we won't make the changes to keep the model to be consistent as same camelCase as it's live for other users
 * API 1: /refdata/judicial/users/search it's all camelCase from the request and also returns with camelCase in the body.
 * API 2: /refdata/judicial/users it's all snake_case from the request and also returns with snake_case in the body.
 * so we need an unified model from ExUI and transform it to JudicialUserModel for API 2
