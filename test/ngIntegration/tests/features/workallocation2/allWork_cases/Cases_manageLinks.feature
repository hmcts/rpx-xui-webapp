    Scenario Outline:  My cases, colums and column links for "<UserType>"
        Given I set MOCK with user "<UserIdentifier>" and roles "<Roles>,task-supervisor,case-allocator" with reference "userDetails"
        Given I set Mock user with ref "userDetails", ORGANISATION roles for services "IA" allow empty service
            | roleName    | task-supervisor |
            | substantive | Y               |

        Given I start MockApp
        Given I navigate to home page

        When I click on primary navigation header tab "All work", I see selected tab page displayed
        When I navigate to All work sub navigation tab "Cases"
        Then I see all work cases not loaded and message displayed as "Please select filters and click Apply"

        Then I see filter "Person" is displayed in all work page
        When I enter find person search input "user1" in work flow

        Then I see find person search results in work flow
            | Person                       |
            | user1 j (judge_user1@gov.uk) |

        When I select find person result "user1 j (judge_user1@gov.uk)" in work flow
        When I click Apply filter button in all work page
        Then I validate work allocation cases count in page 25

        Then I validate manage link actions for cases
            | index | actions           |
            | 1     | Reallocate,Remove |
            | 12    | Reallocate,Remove |

            | UserIdentifier  | UserType | Roles                                                           |
            # | IAC_CaseOfficer_R2 | Caseworker | caseworker-ia-caseofficer,caseworker-ia-admofficer,,task-supervisor |
