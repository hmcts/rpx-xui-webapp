        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l" id="Technical-information-about-this-website’s-accessibility">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">HMCTS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This website is partially compliant with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>
        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l" id="Non-accessible-content">Non-accessible content </h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-compliant for the following reasons.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We have not yet fully tested the service. A full accessibility audit by the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/"> Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)</a> will take place in February 2020. If any non-compliance areas are identified we will update this section and arrange for them to be fixed.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="Non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="Disproportionate-burden">Disproportionate burden</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Some pages cannot be navigated completely using just a keyboard, so some people with accessibility needs won’t be able to tab through the pages. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1 (keyboard accessible).</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Some pages can’t be listened to in full using a screen reader, so some people won’t be able to access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.2.5 (audio description – prerecorded).</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Some of the contrast ratios don’t mind the current accessibility requirements. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 (contrast – minimum).</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Expert UI has carried out manual accessibility testing using the chrome extension Axe. Axe is complying with WCAG 2 and Section 508 accessibility (which covers WCAG 2.1).</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">For Manage Organisation, Register Organisation, Approve Organisation and Manage Cases, we found the following issues that are currently being triaged:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Screen readers can’t switch between headers, read content in tabs and buttons</li>
        <li>Screen readers can’t tab between radio buttons, read links or content </li>
        <li>Colour contrast ratios uneven between page background and content </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="Content-that’s-not-within-the-scope-of-the-accessibility-regulations">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations </h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">PDFs, documents and attachments to email notifications published before 23 September 2018 may not meet accessibility standards. For example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">By September 2020, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages. Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.</p>
        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l" id="How-we-tested-this-website">How we tested this website</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">The platform was manually tested by HMCTS using Pa11y, Axe and VoiceOver. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)</a> will carry out a WCAG 2.1 AA level technical compliance audit across the service in February 2020.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We selected a representative sample of pages from the website to test, covering the range of functionality available.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We tested our main website platform, available at:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>manage-org.platform.hmcts.net</li>

        </ul>
        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l" id="How-we-tested-this-website">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">We’re committed to ensuring our services are accessible to all our customers and that they comply with level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines – WCAG 2.1.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">To help us achieve this, we’ve commissioned the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)</a> to carry out a WCAG 2.1 AA level technical compliance audit that includes over 50 hours of testing by users with a wide range of disabilities. Testing will commence in February 2020 and any issues identified during testing will be reviewed and addressed appropriately.</p>
